# NNG Mining Farm

## Project Overview

NNG Farm is a project that mines through POW., which is a project that is beneficial to the ecological development of the BSC/ETH chain.
Anyone can gain benefits by mining NNG, but the benefits are not only the mining itself. 
But more Easter egg benefits are waiting to be mined.

It implements mining by mining 0x00000000..n proxy contract addresses starting with 0. If you successfully mine 8 consecutive 0 addresses, you can submit to obtain mining rewards. If there are 10 consecutive 0 addresses, you can place a pending order to sell in our pending order market.
In the early stage, 100 BNB are for pre-sale. Every 0.1 BNB can get 100 NNG tokens. The pre-sale target is 100 BNB. After the pre-sale, 10_0000 NNGâž•100 BNB will be added to the liquidity pool in pancakeswap.
Staking rewards: For every 100 NNG pledged for 1 month, 0.12 NNG can be mined per hour. For details, please check the on-chain contract

## Features

- **Smart Contract**: Written in Solidity and deployed on the ETH/BSC/Base... network, supporting secure mining and distribution of tokens.
- **Backend Service**: Developed in Go, responsible for handling user requests, interacting with the smart contract, and managing mining operations.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: Language for smart contract development.
- **Go**: Language for backend service development.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher

### Questions

- How to get NNG
   - Buy From PancakeSwap/Uniswap
   - Pre-sale. Transfer 0.1 BNB/Ether to NNG Contract, you will receive 100 NNG. 
   - Pre-sale. Transfer 1 BNB/Ether to NNG Contract, you will receive 1000 NNG.
- How to start Mining
   - Before mining, you need to pledge [100, 1000] NNG. The pledge operation can be started directly with NNG_Mining for staking.
   - Download NNG_Mining and launch it as follows on your operating system to start mining.

#### Start NNG_Mining

```
NNG_Mining -rpc YOUR_CUSTOM_RPC -run [mining|pledge|claim] -thread DEFAULT_8 -recipient YOUR_REWARD_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS  
```

```
# flags
-rpc 
    Request the rpc node of the blockchain, which can be customized.
    If not set, the default rpc node will be used.
-run 
    mining: By default, it runs as mining. This flag will start your NNG mining journey.
    pledge: You can stake your tokens via -run pledge
    claim: You can withdraw your staked tokens by -run claim
-thread
    Defalt is 8. You can use this flag to define the number of coroutines enabled for mining
-recipient
    You can customize the address where you want to receive mining rewards.
    If not set, the default is the mining address.    
```
